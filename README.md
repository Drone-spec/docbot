# docbot

Moral of the story, I am lazy. I do not wish to write boilerplate markdown for things I have to review so I build this crappy tool to just parse and get like 80% of what I dont want to do by hand. Its not perfect and I like it that way. 

### Syntax

docbot <location to file> < Output name file >
